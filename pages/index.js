Since then I've had the pleasure of working with amazing companies like J&J, Abbvie, Astrazenca, Sanofi, UCB, Takeda, and many more. Considering the human ome-ome is finite (very large, but still finite) I'm obsessed with the idea, and truly believe, that a scalable platform for automated phenotyping could solve all of the worlds NON-LIFESTYLE health problems within a decade.`          }

I remember working with a group of scientists to hand-label a set of clinical notes in the oncology space and thining, wow this sucks, we should really be using a library like Snorkel. I left the company a few weeks later, wrote my first python library for heuristic language labeling, and was able to label around 10,000,000 sentences overnight for a compelex NER and relationship analysis model. While my favorite work is in ML, I'm also an adept yet inefficient full-stack developer who loves to build interfaces for people to interact with my models. "}

My goal is to combine my data-driven dilligence from drug discovery with my passion for building models and interfaces to build a truly next-generation digital health platform that not only accelerates R&D, but makes healthcare free (or at least cheaper) in the process.
