Since then I've had the pleasure of working with amazing companies like J&J, UnitedHealth, Mayo Clinic, Astrazeneca, Genentech, UCB, Takeda, and many more. Considering the human ome-ome is finite (very large, but still finite), I'm obsessed with the idea, and truly believe, that a scalable platform for automated phenotyping could solve >80% of human health problems inside two decades.`          }

My first real experience with the scalability of software was during the early-abyssinia days when I was reading as much as I could about biotech markets, business theory, neuro, and immunology. I wanted a better way to triage and ingest information so the first scripts I ever wrote were built to take in books and summarize them with the classic tfidf sentence weighting. I'd dump my summaries to .txt and use a third party application to play them as abridged e-books --take that blinkist you dorks. While my favorite work is in ML, I'm also an adept yet inefficient full-stack developer who loves to build interfaces for people to interact with my models. "}

My goal is to combine my data-driven dilligence from drug discovery with my passion for building models and interfaces to build a truly next-generation digital health platform that not only accelerates R&D, but makes healthcare free (or at least cheaper) in the process.
