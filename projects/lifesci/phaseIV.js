    descriptionShort:"Using custom NLP models, a simple knowledge graph, React, and FastAPI to automate phase IV clinical research AKA postmarketing surveillance",
    descriptionFull:"Phase IV is the most imporant and least-understood phase of drug development, most people don't even know that its a phase! The gist is that Phase I-III studies do the bare minimum to say 'hey this drug won't kill people if we give it to them right, and also what is the best dose to not kill them and hopefully show some benefit? But once drugs are out in the real world they rarely behave the way they're supposed to, kind've like code. So its imperative that we have a quick feedback system to catch problems that arise (see the thalidomide story in the links). Our current systems really suck at this... like really badly. So I set out to build something better. We ended up with a pretty nifty application that served as the proof-of-concept for what we've now working on at Actually Health. ",
