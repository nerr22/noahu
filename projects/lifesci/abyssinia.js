    "Leading the diagnostic and therapeutic pre-clinical development for a portfolio of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies",
  descriptionFull:
    "The summer after I graduated from college, my best friend from elementary school asked me to join him on what would end up being a life-changing journey to commercialize monoclonal antibodies his savant immunologist father developed in his attic laboratory. It took us a good couple years to get our feet under us but we've landed high-profile collaborators in the academic and pharmaceutical space, raised funding from angels, and are hopefully bringing the most effective Alzheimer's diagnostics and treatments that have ever existed to millions of people around the world. We've come so far, building a robust IP portfolio, an incredible team of diverse advisors, and many friendships along the way. It was the steepest learning curve I've ever experienced, learning enough neuroscience and immunology to not sound like a doofus every day has been incredibly humbling and confidence building at the same time.",
