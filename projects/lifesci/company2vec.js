    descriptionShort:"Can we create emebddings that represent a company's team, assets, and decisions? Can we use these embeddings to automate business strategy, competitive landscaping, and even investing?",
    descriptionFull:"Companies within the same verticals often share similar features. Biotech is a great example of this. Every biotech has a leadership team, commercial/ academic partnerships, assets, and R&D. If we can scrape the linkedin profiles of the leadership team, we can encode all their education and professional experience into a vector which should enable us to compare teams between organizations. Now if we expand that same methodology across their patent portfolios and scientific publications, we can start to see patterns emerge as companies look at new target molecules, mechanisms of action, and disease areas. This information can all be retrospectively aggregated and validated from timestamped news articles and journals. What sort of things would these embeddings show us about success and failure in the business space. What kind of interesting correlations would emerge? IDK dude but if you want me to do this paypal me $150,000 and I'll get right on it :D",
