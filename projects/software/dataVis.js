    descriptionFull:"Ask anybody in New England when the best time to surf is and they'll tell you winter. I don't really mind it considering I've got some junk in the trunk that helps keep me warm seal-style. However 'winter' is a lot of time, and I wanted specifics. Not pacifics, wrong ocean... specifics 🥁🤮🤮🤮. Anyway I use NOAA buoys all the time to check the current surf conditions but I was stoked to see they have historical data as well. It was a breeze to pull it in with Pandas.read_html() and do some cool visualizations with Seaborn to get real concrete data showing that its actually September and April that are the best time to surf. See you out there!",
