    descriptionFull:`I'm scared of the internet because when I was a kid my dad told me everybody I met on world of warcraft was probably a molester. Also like most millenials I got aboslutely fried in call-of-duty lobbies for having a high-pitched voice and after that I vowed never to reveal my true identity online. A few years later, and still with a voice that I wish was a couple octaves lower, here I am realizing I need to be able to put myself out there more. I wanted to build a cool modular site with React but I knew I'd get zingered by the senior devs for using a heavy framework for a static site so, at the behest of my boy Johnny Pribyl, I scooped up next.js and here we are. I hope you like it, feel free to fork it and use it! It is still a work in progress, next steps are:
    1. Optimize for mobile.
    2. Add a scrolling LogoBar in the hero with the companies I've worked with. 
    3. Add a scrollspy for the navbar. 
    4. Add a 'contact' section at the bottom.`,
