    descriptionShort:"Writing my first (soon-to-be open source) library in python for heuristic text labeling and baked in model creation",
    descriptionFull:"I remember the day my boy Forrest Hooton stopped by my desk to tell me about Snorkel. It blew my mind. Look at companies like Scale.ai and Flatiron who have become unicorns just by having people hand-label data and realize that a free python library can do most things they can do. I spent some time digging into heuristic labeling on my own-time and built own my own psuedo-frameworks for quickly and accurately labeling datasets with a combination of manual and procedural pruning. I turned my labeler into a class, and built out methods for handling various cleaning, labeling, sampling, and even training/ testing steps for buidling datasets and training models. I really want to open source it but it needs a little more TLC first. Hopefully I can push it soon.",
