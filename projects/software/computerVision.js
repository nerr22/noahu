    descriptionFull:"I worked with a team of cannabis researchers to build a labled dataset on indoor and outdoor plants for crop-bourn diseases. I used a reverse image search script and random transformations to increase dataset size by over 1000% leading to a F1 score increase of .2 for our resnet based classifier. Subsequent goals include building a GUI with react-native to automatically scan mobile-phone images and live video feed to localize diseased plants.",
