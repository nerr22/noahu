    title:"The Future of WearablesâŒš",
    descriptionShort:"Current wearables solutions provide very little clinical utility. Metrics like steps are more of a novelty for bio-hackers than a clinical evaluation tool. How could we do it better?",
    descriptionFull:"Coming soon: My first prototype in this space was seeing if I could use pull an accurate ECG from a capactative touch screen, and how would the signal compare to a single lead from a smart watch. The big issue I ran into --aside from my old verizon galaxy s6 being impossible to root-- was that the signal picked up from the touch-screen was both weak and extremely noisy. My next goal is to see if I can build an additional neural layer ontop of the signal to both amplify and denoise it. This will require a significant amount of training data which we hope to generate through Actually Health. This is another great example of technology that could be rapidly prototyped without having to deal with regulatory hurdles and a lack of useful data. Once we have infrastructure in place for easily and accurately monitoring clinically relevant biosignatures remotely, we can start to really open the world up to accessible and affordable remote care. Before somebody emails me and says 'Noah smart watches have single lead ECG already', I want to point out that 85% of Americans own a smartphone vs 45% who wear smart watches. Thats nearly double the addressable market. And depending on hardware limitations we're talking about substantially more accessible remote ECG because it can be pushed out as software instead of hardware.",
