    descriptionFull:"My first 'cool' job out of high-school was working for Margo Walsh, the founder of MaineWorks, driving felons and people in recovery to work. Margo is an absolute mutant in the best way, and has been able to make a quantifiable impact on the opiod crisis that is orders of magnitude better than costly gov't programs or over-hyped air-dropped suboxone through the blockchain --joke. Margo showed me that you can build a profitable business that out-performs NPOs and gov't orgs in both societal value and financacial benefit. Thats the american dream baby and I'm proud to say I'm still working with Margo leading healthcare partnerships and innovation.",
