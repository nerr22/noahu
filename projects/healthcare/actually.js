    descriptionFull:"Companies like flatiron, iqvia, and nference have a fundamental flaw. They ignore supply chain contstrains on their data. Everybody talks about how 'big data' is going to fix healthcare as if 'big data' just exists and we can use it. They don't realize big data needs to be transated from objective and subjective human experience into data first. That is the rate limiting step and that is why I founded Actually. Our engine is powered by an ensemble of biomedical and clinical knowledge graphs that we couple with a data-focused UI to help patients generate clinically relevant insights.",
