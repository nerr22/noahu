    descriptionShort:"My Vision of Health 3.0: Using heuristic labeling philosophy to augment patients in generating high value RWE. Value so high their care is free $$$$",
    descriptionFull:"'RWE' companies like iqvia and flatiron have a fundamental flaw. They ignore supply chain constraints on their data. Everybody talks about how 'big data' is going to fix healthcare as if 'big data' is both passively generated, and inherently structured in a useful manner. Little, if any, thought is given to the complexities of taking subjective human experiences and making them computable at scale. That is the rate limiting step and that is why I founded Actually. Our engine is powered by an ensemble of biomedical and clinical knowledge graphs that we couple with a data-focused UI to help patients generate clinically relevant insights. With a scalable automated phenoytping platform like ours, critical health infrastructure research like pharmacogenomics is as easy as set it and forget it. At least, that's the plan.",
